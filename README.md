# RestiBesti

#### Your friendly neighborhood restaurant app. Add your favorite restaurants and leave reviews.
#### Additionally, if the user is feeling spontaneous, they can allow the app to chose a restaurant for them.

## Technologies Used:

#### HTML, CSS and Javascript were the coding languages used. RestiBesti is a Full-stack CRUD appicationNode/Express/MongoDB app built from the ground up.
#### RestiBesti also uses OAuth authentication to implement basic authorization that restricts access to features that need a logged in user (adding reviews, viewing restaurants).


## Getting Started: Include a link to the deployed app and your Trello board with the project's planning.

## Next Steps: 

#### I would love to use an API or add links to where the user is able to be directed to GrubHub or Seamless where they can order their food.
